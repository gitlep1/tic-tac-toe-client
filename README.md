LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES USED
* HTML
* SCSS
* JAVASCRIPT
* JQUERY


  PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT STORY: 
  
  To plan out how to make this Tic-Tac-Toe game I came up with a wireframe diagram so that I would know exactly how I      wanted my website to look. After that I took the time to plan out which section of the code would do what:
  
  HTML
* the title
* the form fields
* the boxes
* the messages
* the buttons
* the borders

  SCSS
* styling the title
* styling the forms 
* styling the hover image (dancing X & O)
* styling the board 
* styling the background
* making the game board

  JAVASCRIPT
* controlling the API stuff
* putting the player on the board
* hiding unnecessary information
* getting the number of games played
* filling in the array
* allowing the user to sign-up, sign-in, sign-out and change their password
* allowing the user to start a new game
* clearing the board
* clearing the array
* switching between X & O

After I organized everything I got to work starting with the HTML then doing the SCSS and lastly ending with the JAVASCRIPT(which was not easy!). Whenever i did not know how to do something I would ask for help (never be afraid of asking for help) and look it up online.

  UNSOLVED ISSUES
  * getting the hover gif image to switch between the dancing X and dancing O
  * setting a better board color so it doesn't clash with the background gif
  * getting the background gif to not be so staticy on firefox (might be a firefox thing)
  * setting the "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe" title to a rainbow color animation
  * Giving users the option to choose between Small, Medium and Large game board
    (Small would be the normal 3x3 game board)
    (Medium would be 2x bigger then Small (6x6))
    (Large would be 2x bigger then medium (12x12)
    while still being 3 in a row
  * putting the form fields inside a button that you press to make them show up (modal)
