  PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT STORY: 
  
  To plan out how to make this Tic-Tac-Toe game I came up with a wireframe diagram so that I would know exactly how I      wanted my website to look. After that I took the time to plan out which section of the code would do what like so:
  
  HTML                      SCSS/CSS                                   JAVASCRIPT
 title                  styling the title                             controlling the API stuff
 the form fields        styling the forms                             putting the player on the board
 the boxes              styling the hover image (dancing X & O)       hiding unnecessary information
 the messages           styling the board                             getting the number of games played
 the buttons            styling the background                        
 the borders            making the game board
