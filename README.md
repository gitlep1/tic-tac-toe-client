  PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT STORY: 
  
  To plan out how to make this Tic-Tac-Toe game I came up with a wireframe diagram so that I would know exactly how I      wanted my website to look. After that I took the time to plan out which section of the code would do what:
  
  HTML
* the title
* the form fields
* the boxes
* the messages
* the buttons
* the borders

  SCSS
* styling the title
* styling the forms 
* styling the hover image (dancing X & O)
* styling the board 
* styling the background
* making the game board


  JAVASCRIPT
* controlling the API stuff
* putting the player on the board
* hiding unnecessary information
* getting the number of games played
* filling in the array
* allowing the user to sign-up, sign-in, sign-out and change their password
* allowing the user to start a new game
* clearing the board
* clearing the array
* switching between X & O

After I organized everything I got to work starting with the HTML then doing the SCSS and lastly ending with the JAVASCRIPT(which was not easy!). Whenever i did not know how to do something I would ask for help (never be afraid of asking for help) and look it up online.
